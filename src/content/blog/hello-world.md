So… here we go. My first post on this thing.

I've been meaning to start some kind of dev journal for a while. Most of my coding journey so far has been scattered - random notes in Notion, scribbles in a terminal, half-baked side projects sitting in repos that never see the light of day. I forget more than I remember, and that's kind of frustrating.

This blog - **`ReferenceError`** - is my attempt to fix that. A place to dump what I'm learning, what I'm breaking, and what I'm figuring out along the way.

### Why "ReferenceError”?

Because honestly, errors are 90% of the journey.  
I've lost count of how many times I've seen something like:

```js
ReferenceError: x is not defined
```

At first it was terrifying. Then annoying. Then kind of funny. Now I see it as a reminder: "you're close, but you're missing a piece.” That's basically the whole vibe of learning to code.

So yeah, I named the blog after it. Own the pain, laugh at the mistakes, keep moving.

### What You'll Probably See Here

- Me wrestling with bugs and hopefully winning.
- Notes on stuff I'm currently learning - web dev, programming, random tools.
- Things I'll probably forget if I don't write them down.
- Maybe some experiments, half-finished projects, and little victories.

This isn't meant to be a tutorial site. It's not polished. It's not optimized. It's literally my coding diary, but on the internet.

### Why Bother Writing?

Partly for me - writing forces me to slow down and think. If I can explain something, even badly, I probably understand it better than before.

Partly for fun - I like the idea of looking back a year from now and cringing at how little I knew (and also feeling proud of how far I came).

And maybe, just maybe, someone else might stumble here and find something useful. If that happens, cool. If not, it still did its job.

So yeah. That's it. Post number one.  
A messy start, but a start.
